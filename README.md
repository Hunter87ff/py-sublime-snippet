#  Python  Snippets
I was missing some important and necassary code snippets of python in sublime text, so i decided to make my own. and i think  beyond me, it can help other people who use sublime text as their primary code editor.

## Key Features:
- Conditional statements
- loops
- classes
- lambda
- uitlities
## Example snippet

**Triger : class**
```py
class ClassName(object) :
    def __init__(self, arg):
        super(ClassName, self).__init__()
        self.arg = arg
    def function(param):
        #Code
```

## Installation
**Step 1:**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Hunter87ff/py-sublime-snippet
```

**Step 2:**<br>
Copy the folder and past it in this directory `sublime-text/packages/User/snippets/`
