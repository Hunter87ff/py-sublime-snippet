====================
     Changelog
====================

Thanks again for downloading this package!

Changes from v1.2.0 to v1.2.5 include:

- Preprocessor snippets end with a newline.
- New snippet: `beginend_` which expands to `begin($1), end($1)`.
- Removal of the source.c++11 scope
- New category of snippets: traits
    - Implements different ways of making type traits
    - To avoid conflict these will have the cpptrait prefix
    - Currently, only one is provided: cpptraitfun to create a type trait
      based on trait inheritance.
- MIT license is wrapped to 80-column (thanks @miquelmassot)
- install message is now wrapped properly (thanks @kleinfreund)
- exception snippet now inherits from `std::runtime_error`.
- exception snippet no longer has a noexcept constructor
